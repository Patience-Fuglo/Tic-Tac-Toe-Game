GAME DESCRIPTION:
There is a board with 3 x 3 squares/grid.
The two players take turns putting "x" or "O" on board. The goal of the game is for one of the players to get three of the same symbols and colors in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. The first player to match three Xs or Os with their colors coordinates, vertically, horizontally and diagonally wins the game. and the other player loses the game.

If none of the players match their Xs and Os and color coordinates, vertically, diagonally and horizontally and all the board are filled, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
